Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model that classifies whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signal data. The model is trained using Python and leverages various machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in classification.

Features
Dataset: Uses sonar signal dataset for training and testing.
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection for better performance.
Modeling: Implements classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Evaluation: Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Deployment: The model can be integrated into applications for real-time predictions.

Result
The model achieves high accuracy in classifying objects based on sonar data. Performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.
